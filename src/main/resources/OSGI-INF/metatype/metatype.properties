# Distributing Event Handler
dist.events.name = Apache Sling Distributing Event Handler 
dist.events.description = Distributes local OSGi Event Admin events to \
 other nodes of the same cluster. The events are written to the JCR \
 repository for distribution to other nodes while events written to the \
 repository are picked up and distributed locally through the OSGi Event Admin \
 Service.   

scheduler.period.name = Cleanup Internal
scheduler.period.description = Interval in seconds in which events older than \
 a specific age (see Event Cleanup Age) are purged from the repository. \
 The default value is 30 minutes (1800 seconds).

cleanup.period.name = Event Cleanup Age
cleanup.period.description = The maximum age in minutes of persisted events to \
 be purged from the repository during the cleanup run. The default is 15 \
 minutes. Note that this setting defines the minimum time an event remains \
 in the repository. 


#
# Queue Configuration and Job Event Handler
queue.name = Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration
queue.description = The configuration of a job processing queue.

queue.name.name = Name
queue.name.description = The name of the queue. If matching is used \
 the token \{0\} can be used to substitute the real value.

queue.type.name = Type
queue.type.description = The queue type.

queue.topics.name = Topics
queue.topics.description = This value is required and lists the topics processed by \
 this queue. The value is a list of strings. If a string ends with a dot, \
 all topics in exactly this package match. If the string ends with a star, \
 all topics in this package and all subpackages match. If the string neither \
 ends with a dot nor with a star, this is assumed to define an exact topic.

queue.priority.name = Priority
queue.priority.description = The priority for the threads from this queue. Default is norm.

queue.retries.name = Maximum Retries
queue.retries.description = The maximum number of times a failed job slated \
 for retries is actually retried. If a job has been retried this number of \
 times and still fails, it is not rescheduled and assumed to have failed. The \
 default value is 10.

queue.retrydelay.name = Retry Delay
queue.retrydelay.description = The number of milliseconds to sleep between two \
 consecutive retries of a job which failed and was set to be retried. The \
 default value is 2 seconds. This value is only relevant if there is a single \
 failed job in the queue. If there are multiple failed jobs, each job is \
 retried in turn without an intervening delay.

queue.maxparallel.name = Maximum Parallel Jobs
queue.maxparallel.description = The maximum number of parallel jobs started for this queue. \
 A value of -1 is substituted with the number of available processors.

queue.runlocal.name = Run Local
queue.runlocal.description = Jobs for this queue are only processed on the cluster node \
 where the job has been started.
 
queue.applicationids.name = Application Ids
queue.applicationids.description = An optional list of application ids. If configured, \
 jobs for this queue are only processed on those cluster nodes.

 
#
# Job Event Handler
job.events.name = Apache Sling Job Event Handler 
job.events.description = Manages job scheduling on a single system as well \
 as on a cluster. A Job runs only on a single cluster node. \
 The respective scheduling is persisted in the repository and distributed \
 amongst the cluster nodes through repository events. The jobs are started \
 locally on a single cluster node through the OSGi Event Admin.

jobscheduler.period.name = Cleanup Internal
jobscheduler.period.description = Interval in seconds in which unused \
 queues are stopped. The default value is 5 minutes (300 seconds).


#
# Persistence Handler
job.persistence.name = Apache Sling Job Persistence Manager
job.persistence.description = This service persists and loads jobs from the repository.

persscheduler.period.name = Event Cleanup Internal
persscheduler.period.description = Interval in seconds in which jobs older than \
 a specific age (see Event Cleanup Age) are purged from the repository. \
 The default value is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

sleep.time.name = Retry Interval
sleep.time.description = The number of milliseconds to sleep between two \
 consecutive retries of a job which failed and was set to be retried. The \
 default value is 30 seconds. This value is only relevant if there is a single \
 failed job in the queue. If there are multiple failed jobs, each job is \
 retried in turn without an intervening delay.

jobcleanup.period.name = Event Cleanup Age
jobcleanup.period.description = The maximum age in minutes of persisted job to \
 be purged from the repository during the cleanup run. The default is 5 \
 minutes. Note that this setting defines the minimum time an event remains \
 in the repository. 

max.load.jobs.name = Max Load Jobs
max.load.jobs.description = The maximum amount of jobs being loaded from the repository on startup. \
 Default is 1000 jobs.

load.threshold.name = Load Threshold
load.threshold.description = If the queue is lower than this threshold the repository is checked \
 for events. The default value is 400. This works together with the maximum load jobs.

load.delay.name = Background Load Delay
load.delay.description = The background loader waits this time of seconds after startup before \
 loading events from the repository. Default value is 30 seconds.

load.checkdelay.name = Background Check Delay
load.checkdelay.description = The background loader sleeps this time of seconds before \
 checking the repository for jobs. Default value is 240 seconds.

#
# Event Pool
event.pool.name = Apache Sling Event Thread Pool 
event.pool.description = This is the thread pool used by the Apache Sling eventing support.

minPoolSize.name = Min Pool Size
minPoolSize.description = The minimum pool size. The minimum pool size should be \
 higher than 20. Approx 10 threads are in use by the system, so a pool size of 20 \
 allows to process 10 events in parallel.

maxPoolSize.name = Max Pool Size
maxPoolSize.description = The maximum pool size. The maximum pool size should be higher than \
 or equal to the minimum pool size.

priority.name = Priority
priority.description = The priority for the threads from this pool. Default is norm.
